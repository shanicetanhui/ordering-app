# Customer Ordering App

This is a **Customer Ordering App** for a two-person project demonstrating inter-application communication using **RabbitMQ**.

Built with **Svelte + TypeScript** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend, this system allows users to place simple food and drink orders which are sent to another system (Person B) via RabbitMQ.

The two apps communicate via RabbitMQ using a shared `orders` message queue.
